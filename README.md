# Reddit-Media-Scraper

Reddit media scraper is an application which simplifies the process of scraping data from the popular social media platform ‘Reddit’. This allows the user to download the media such as images or videos from a subreddit ( Subreddit is a page where people with the same interests can post their messages or share media ). Users can also search for their favourite subreddits and can filter the results. This application is built using the open-source framework named ‘Electron’, and utilises web technologies like Javascript, HTML and CSS to create a desktop application along with NodeJS.
